# Hospital-Bed-Occupancy-Analysis:
This project focuses on predicting hospital bed availability using machine learning techniques. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and model implementation to identify key factors influencing occupancy. Regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Tree, and Random Forest, were applied to improve prediction accuracy. The project utilizes Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-Learn, and visualization tools like Matplotlib and Seaborn to analyze and interpret data effectively.

#Tools:
